    :alt: Documentation Status

**blackdoc** is a tool that applies `black`_ to code in documentation.

It was originally a rewrite of a `gist`_ and called
**black-doctest**. In April 2020, it was renamed to **blackdoc**.

.. _more-itertools: https://github.com/more-itertools/more-itertools
.. _rich: https://github.com/textualize/rich
.. _tomli: https://github.com/hukkin/tomli
.. _pathspec: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec
.. _importlib-metadata: https://github.com/python/importlib_metadata

Install it with:

    python -m pip install blackdoc

Usage
-----
The commandline interface supports two modes: checking and inplace
reformatting.

.. code:: bash

    python -m blackdoc --help


In inplace reformatting mode, it will reformat the doctest lines and
write them back to disk:

.. code:: bash

    # on explicitly mentioned files
    python -m blackdoc file1.py file2.py
    # on the whole directory
    python -m blackdoc .


When checking, it will report the changed files but will not write them to disk:

.. code:: bash

    python -m blackdoc --check .

It is also possible to use the entrypoint script:

.. code:: bash

    blackdoc --help
