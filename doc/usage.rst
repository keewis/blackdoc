Usage
-----
**blackdoc** tries to copy as much of the CLI of **black** as
possible. This means that most calls to **black** can be directly
translated to **blackdoc**:

To reformat specific files, use:

.. code:: sh

   python -m blackdoc file1 file2 ...

while passing directories reformats all files in those directories
that match the file format specified by ``--include`` and
``--exclude``:

.. code:: sh

   python -m blackdoc directory1 directory2 ...

mixing directories and files is also possible.

As an example, having a structure like::

    directory
    â”œâ”€â”€ file.py
    â””â”€â”€ file.rst

with

.. literalinclude:: directory/file.py

.. literalinclude:: directory/file.rst
   :language: rst

If we run

.. code:: sh

    python -m blackdoc directory

we get

.. literalinclude:: directory/reformatted.py

.. literalinclude:: directory/reformatted.rst
   :language: rst

If instead we run

.. code:: sh

    python -m blackdoc --check directory

the result is::

    would reformat directory/file.rst
    would reformat directory/file.py
    Oh no! ðŸ’¥ ðŸ’” ðŸ’¥
    2 files would be reformatted.

with a non-zero exit status.
